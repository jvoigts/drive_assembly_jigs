# An easy-to-assemble, robust, and ultralight drive implant for chronic tetrode recordings in freely moving animals

Licensed under CERN OHL v.1.2


The basic design uses polymicro fused silica tubes as free standing shuttle tubes to avoid having to use bent guide tubes.
The shuttles are 3d printed or milled teflon sliding in slots in a 3d printed body, moved by captive custom screws.
The straight bottom guide tube array can either be milled, or made in the classical fashion from bundled and cut polymide tubes, or even 3d printed in a ultra-high precision process(?).

The captive custom drive screws (currently M0.6 for mouse and M0.8 for rat/shrew) incorporate a captive guide feature under the screw head that is held by epoxy or dental acrylic in a well at the top of the drive after the screws have been inserted into the drive body, ensuring minimal hysteresis and very quick assembly. The bottom of the screws are captive in a hole at the drive body base giving them addiitonal stability.
